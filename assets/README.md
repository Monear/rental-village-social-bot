## How Screenshots Are Used

These screenshots appear in the main README under the "How It Works" section, showing:
1. Content pipeline in Notion (multiple posts being managed)
2. AI-generated post example (what the draft looks like)
3. Published Facebook post (final result after human polish)

They visually demonstrate the workflow: **AI generates 0→1 draft → Humans polish → Auto-publish to Facebook**

## Design Guidelines

**For Screenshots:**
- Resolution: 1200-1600px width
- Redact sensitive information if needed
- Clear, focused captures showing relevant content
- Annotations optional (content speaks for itself)

# Image Generation Instructions for AI

## Goal
Generate 2-3 high-quality, photorealistic DIY images that look like genuine, unstaged snapshots taken by a skilled hobbyist or contractor. Images should be suitable for both inspiration and direct use in production social media posts for a tool rental company.

## Prompt Engineering Framework
- **Subject:** Clearly specify the main subject (e.g., a tool, a person using a tool, a completed DIY project).
- **Context & Background:** Place the subject in a realistic, relevant setting (e.g., home garage, backyard, jobsite, garden, or interior room). Use backgrounds that add story and context, not just plain or abstract backgrounds.
- **Style:** Always request a high-resolution, photorealistic photograph. Use photography-specific modifiers (e.g., 35mm, macro, wide angle, natural lighting, shallow depth of field, bokeh, HDR, 4K, professional, candid, documentary style, etc.).
- **Lighting:** Specify natural, realistic lighting (e.g., golden hour, soft daylight, overcast, or dramatic shadows) to enhance authenticity.
- **Composition:** Use clear focal points, strong composition, and avoid clutter. Try different camera angles (e.g., close-up, wide shot, aerial, from below, portrait orientation, etc.).
- **Details:** Avoid watermarks, text overlays, extra hands, distorted objects, or visual artifacts. Hands, faces, and tools should appear natural and undistorted. If people are present, specify facial details, expressions, and diversity.
- **Diversity:** For multiple images, vary the perspective, setting, time of day, and project stage. Use different camera positions, lens types, and lighting conditions for each variation.
- **Quality Modifiers:** Always include terms like "high-quality", "professional", "4K", "HDR", "studio photo", "by a professional photographer" to maximize realism.
- **Aspect Ratio:** Default to square (1:1) for social media, but consider 4:3, 16:9, or 9:16 for variety if needed.
- **Iteration:** If the first result is not ideal, refine the prompt by adding or adjusting details (e.g., "with a clean background", "in use by a smiling person", "in golden hour light").

## Example Prompt Templates
- A high-quality, photorealistic 35mm photo of a [subject] in a [context], natural lighting, shallow depth of field, professional, candid, 4K.
- A close-up macro photograph of [subject] being used in a [setting], sharp focus, bokeh background, HDR, by a professional photographer.
- A wide-angle shot of a [DIY project] in progress, golden hour lighting, documentary style, authentic environment, 4K.
- A portrait of a person using [tool] in a [setting], smiling, natural expression, soft daylight, professional, 35mm lens.

## Output
For each variation, generate an image that visually represents the provided content description or keywords. Focus on realism, clarity, and the primary subject. Each image should be ready for use as a brand social post or as creative inspiration. Use the above framework to maximize authenticity and visual impact.

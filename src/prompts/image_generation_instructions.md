# Image Generation Instructions for AI

## Goal
Generate 2-3 high-quality, realistic DIY photos that look like genuine, unstaged snapshots taken by a skilled hobbyist or contractor. Images should be suitable for both inspiration and direct use in production social media posts for a tool rental company.

## Directives
* **Authenticity:** Images must look like real photos, not AI-generated or synthetic. Avoid surreal, painterly, or obviously digital elements.
* **DIY Context:** Show real people (if present) using tools, working on projects, or showcasing results in authentic home, yard, or jobsite settings. Clothing, tools, and environments should be plausible and relatable.
* **Lighting & Composition:** Use natural lighting and realistic shadows. Avoid harsh filters, over-saturation, or unnatural color grading. Composition should be clear, with a strong focal point and minimal clutter.
* **Details:** No watermarks, text overlays, extra hands, distorted objects, or visual artifacts. Hands, faces, and tools should appear natural and undistorted.
* **Diversity:** If generating multiple images, vary the perspective, setting, and subject (e.g., different angles, times of day, or project stages).
* **Safety & Appropriateness:** All images must be safe for work and suitable for a general audience.

## Output
For each variation, generate an image that visually represents the provided content description or keywords. Focus on realism, clarity, and the primary subject. Each image should be ready for use as a brand social post or as creative inspiration.

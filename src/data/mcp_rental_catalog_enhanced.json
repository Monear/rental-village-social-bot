The unique swivel handlebar featured on this compact unit means you can walk alongside your tiller rather than in your freshly tilled earth. Dont let this narrow machine fool you, with its heavy design the tiller works for you instead of tossing you around. Counter-rotating tines break up the most difficult soil, clay, or sod. Wheels and tines work independently of each other to allow your tilling travel speed to be adjusted to the soil conditions. This easy to use machine comes on it own trailer for easy pick-up (2 ball required). Call your local store and book yours today!",

Dont be alarmed by the appearance as the lawn will fill back in as the nutrients are able to sink in. You will find this to work best if you wait until your grass has greened up after winter and can be done at any point after that providing you supply enough moisture to help it recover.",

Unit uses three hydraulic hoses so if you plan on using your own skid steer ensure you have the correct fittings available. Care needs to be taken when sweeping around obstacles as damage waiver will not cover damage caused by striking something and bending it. Best to consider a hand held power broom to do around the edges which we can rent you as well. This unit is available only at our Carleton Place location so reach out to us to book. I you need to rent a skidsteer as well the SV65 Kubota will be the best unit for it.",

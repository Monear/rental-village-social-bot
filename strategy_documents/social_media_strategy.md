    *   **Project Spotlights:** Showcasing completed customer projects (with permission).
    *   **Tool Tips Tuesday:** Short video or graphic with a useful tip for a specific tool.
    *   **Ask the Expert:** Answering common customer questions.
    *   **Behind the Scenes:** Featuring the Rental Village team and maintenance processes.
*   **Goal:** To build trust, foster community, and provide value beyond just renting equipment.

## 6. Blogging Strategy

# Social Media Content Guidelines

## Our Voice & Tone

*   **Helpful & Expert:** We are seasoned professionals who know our tools inside and out. Our tone should be confident, informative, and encouraging.
*   **Community-Focused:** We are part of the local community of builders, DIY-ers, and contractors. Use "we," "us," and "our" to foster a sense of partnership.
*   **Approachable, Not Corporate:** Avoid jargon. Speak like a friendly expert you'd meet at the hardware store. Use clear, simple language.
*   **Safety-Conscious:** Always prioritize safety in how-to guides and tool spotlights.

## Content Pillars

These are the core themes of our social media content. Every post should align with one of these pillars.

1.  **Project of the Week:** Showcase a completed project (either by a customer or an in-house example) that was made possible with our tools. Highlight the transformation.
2.  **Tool Spotlight:** A deep dive into a specific tool. This can be a video demo, a carousel of features, or a "pro-tip" on how to get the most out of it.
3.  **How-To Guide:** Simple, step-by-step instructions for common DIY projects that require tool rentals (e.g., "How to Prepare a Lawn for Sod," "5 Steps to a Perfect Patio").
4.  **Customer Feature:** Celebrate our customers! Share their work (with permission) and tag their business. This builds community and provides social proof.
5.  **Safety First:** Short, actionable tips for operating equipment safely. This builds trust and shows we care about our customers' well-being.

## Post Format

*   **Keep it Concise:** Aim for 2-3 short sentences.
*   **Use Emojis:** Sparingly, to add personality (e.g., 🛠️, ✅, 🌱).
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** Every post should have a clear CTA. Examples: "Rent the [Tool Name] today!", "Link in bio for the full guide," "Tag a friend who needs this!"
*   **Hashtags:** Use a mix of general and specific hashtags (e.g., #ToolRental #DIYProjects #Landscaping #LocalContractor #[YourCityName]).
